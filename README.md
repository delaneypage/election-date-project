## election-date-project

_What is this?_ 

A repository for collecting, cleaning, and storing election date data. 

_Why?_

When working with election data, there are often situations when it'd be handy to have the actual date of, say, the 2008 Georgia Presidential Primary. The problem is that these data are scattered around the internet in different formats. This makes it incredibly difficult to filter or compare these data in many applications, from simple visualizations to cross-sectional analysis. 

_How did you collect these data?_

The first version of this dataset was semi-collected by hand through the reports posted by the Federal Election Commission and partially generated by generating datetime ranges. For the cleaning code, PDFs, and original Excel spreadsheets for the first version of this dataset, see /archive. 

Moving forward, the hope is to curate a series of websites or APIs which this dataset can regularly pull from to update these data.
